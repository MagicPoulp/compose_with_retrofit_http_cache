Remarks on possible improvements:

--> Avoid LaunchedEffects and use only the view model

I justified for each why a LaunchedEffect is necessary

--> use a singleton in hilt and not an initialized boolean
See the text, I did an experience restarting the activity and the
view model does not call the constructor

I renamed the init() function startPagerAndDataFetching() to make clear it is called manually just once to fetch data,
and I explained why the boolean is necessary.

--> use many view models

--> add use cases

--> all things related to data should go into a repository

--> refetchArtDetail should lie in a use case
