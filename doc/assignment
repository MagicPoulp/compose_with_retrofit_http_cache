tem Details

When a user clicks on an item in the list, display detailed information about the selected item.

Endpoint: GET /api/[culture]/collection/[object-number]

API Calls:

Use Coroutines to make asynchronous API calls to retrieve data for the filtered list and item details.

Ensure proper error handling and data parsing.

Offline Mode (Bonus):

Implement an "Offline Mode" feature that allows users to access previously fetched data when the device is offline.

Code Quality:

Maintain clean and well-documented code.

Follow the principles of SOLID, and ensure your code is maintainable and testable.

Additional Considerations:

Implement navigation between the filtered list and item details screens.

Handle configuration changes gracefully.

Handle edge cases and errors effectively.

Use of third party libraries must be justified.


Submission:
Once you have completed the project, send us the GitHub repository link, any additional setup instructions, and a brief documentation outlining your app's architecture, how to build and run it, and any notable design patterns or libraries you used.


Assessment: Your work will be evaluated based on the quality of your code, adherence to best practices, UI/UX design, error handling, and the overall functionality and performance of the app.
