# Assimgnet's questions

- give us your context at the time you did this skills test. Were you stressed/relaxed, under some constraints?
- present your work; explain its architecture, main components and how they interact with each other. Feel free to include diagrams as appropriate. Hand-drawn is fine.
- explain where you applied some developers' good practices: design pattern, SOLID, KISS, DRY principles, etc...
- explain your development strategy:
    - if you favored some functionalities or layers
    - your commits strategy
- explain if your code is future-proof (scalable, robust to changes, etc...)
